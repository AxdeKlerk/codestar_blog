# This code defines the URL patterns for the "about" app in a Django project. It imports the necessary views and the path function from Django's URL module. The urlpatterns list contains a single path that maps the root URL of the "about" app to the about_me view, which is responsible for rendering the About page. The name 'about' is assigned to this URL pattern for easy reference in templates and other parts of the application.
# This code is typically placed in a file named urls.py within the "about" app directory. It allows the Django project to route requests to the appropriate view function when users visit the About page of the website.
